# Time Series Analysis of Electricity Prices

This repository contains the Python notebooks and data used for the time series analysis of residential electricity prices. The project aims to identify trends, seasonality, and residuals within the electricity price data, and to model these series using SARIMA models for better understanding and forecasting.

## Project Description

The primary focus of this project is to analyze the historical electricity prices to ultimate customers in the residential sector. Using various time series techniques, we explore underlying patterns such as seasonality and trends, and develop models to forecast future prices.

All data was downloaded from:
